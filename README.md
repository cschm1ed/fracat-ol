Fract-ol is a computer graphics project that focuses on exploring and rendering fractals using the MiniLibX library. By completing this project, I gained valuable experience in creating basic computer graphics, working with complex numbers, understanding the basics of optimization in computer graphics, and handling events.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Modular Code**: Acquired skills in writing modular code, making it easy to add features and maintain the codebase in the long run.
- **Structs**: Gained experience in using structs for organizing data and improving code readability.
- **Event Handling**: Mastered handling user events like zooming, moving the view, and changing color ranges to enhance user experience.
- **Graphics Library**: Developed proficiency in using the MiniLibX library for opening windows, creating images, and handling keyboard and mouse events.
- **Basics of Optimization**: Gained an understanding of the basics of optimization in computer graphics.

## Implementation Rules

The project adheres to the following rules:

- It uses the MiniLibX library for graphics rendering and event handling.
- A Makefile compiles the source files without relinking.
- Global variables are forbidden.
- It renders the Julia set and the Mandelbrot set fractals.
- Users can zoom in and out, move the view, and change color ranges.
- The program accepts command-line parameters to define the fractal type and rendering options.
- Proper error handling for invalid or missing parameters is implemented.
- Allowed functions include open, close, read, write, malloc, free, perror, strerror, exit, math library functions, MiniLibX library functions, and ft_printf or any equivalent functions I coded.

Through Fract-ol, I gained practical experience with computer graphics concepts and learned to work with new libraries.
